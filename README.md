# TF_Colab_Bot
[HackMD doc](https://hackmd.io/j8FV3tJtTAisG3tzhdmZcg)
This bot conects TF's with eachopther by starting a DM between TF's. The purpose of the bot is to promote comunity between TFs at diffrent schools. 

There is 2 paths this Bot can go:
Path 1 :
Random/non random paring of students witch only focus os to send a Dm and ask them to have a conversation/coffey chat togther 

Path 2: 
Have the bot create our Pods and those pods will be used in our TF Training. 
If we do that we can send meessages as the bot to each Pod and give them assighments or materials. 

Requirments:
- Get a list of users from a slack channel 
- get user info eg:email, school name
- reactions to a bot 
- create a Dm with 2 or more users 

**General Idea for meetup with no repeats**
